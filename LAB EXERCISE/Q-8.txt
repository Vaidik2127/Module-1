1.Client Tier (User Interface)
What it is: This is what the user sees and interacts with (like a website or app).
Example: A webpage you visit in your browser.
What it does: Shows you the information and sends your requests (like login or search) to the server.

2. Web Tier (Application)
What it is: This is the server that handles your requests.
Example: The websiteâ€™s backend that processes your login or search request.
What it does: It takes your request, decides what to do, and asks the database for the information if needed.

3. Data Tier (Database)
What it is: This is where all the data is stored.
Example: A database that holds your account info or product details.
What it does: Stores and gives back data when the web server asks for it.
