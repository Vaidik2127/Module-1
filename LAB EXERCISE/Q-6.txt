Explanation:-
-------------
1.SQL Injection (SQLi):
Problem: Malicious input inserted into SQL queries to manipulate the database.
Solution: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

2.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Problem: Malicious JavaScript injected into web pages, executed by other users.
Solution: Sanitize user inputs, use Content Security Policy (CSP).

3.Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
Problem: An attacker tricks a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens to validate requests.
