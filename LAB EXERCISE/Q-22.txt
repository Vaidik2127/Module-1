Explanation of the Flow:
-----------------------
Issue: The bug in the scheduling system disrupted patient appointments due to date-time handling problems.

Impact: Patient care was delayed, operational inefficiency occurred, and there was risk of HIPAA non-compliance.

Cause: The issue was due to a bug introduced by a software update that didnâ€™t properly handle time zones and daylight saving time.

Maintenance Actions: Immediate rollback and manual override were applied, followed by root cause analysis and fixing the date-time handling logic.

Outcome: The system was successfully fixed, and patient appointments were correctly managed and HIPAA compliance was maintained.
