Explanation:

1.Broadband (DSL, Cable):
Pros: Affordable, reliable, fast enough for general use.
Cons: Limited speed, depends on distance from exchange, shared bandwidth in cable.

2.Fiber Optic:
Pros: Very fast speeds, low latency, reliable.
Cons: Expensive, limited availability, especially in rural areas.

3.Satellite:
Pros: Available in remote areas, global coverage.
Cons: High latency, weather impact, slow speeds.

4.5G Mobile Hotspot:
Pros: Portable, fast speeds (in urban areas), low latency.
Cons: Limited coverage, can be expensive, signal interference.

5.Mobile Hotspot (Cellular Data):
Pros: Portable, no physical infrastructure needed.
Cons: Speed limits, data caps, dependent on cellular network.

6.Dial-Up Internet:
Pros: Cheap, available in rural areas with phone lines.
Cons: Extremely slow speeds, no simultaneous phone usage, outdated.
