Q-31. What are the pros and cons of desktop applications compared to web applications?
Ans:- Desktop Applications

Pros:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Faster: Works faster since it uses your computer's resources directly.
Works Offline: Doesn’t need the internet to run.
Full Access to Device: Can use all your device’s features (camera, storage, etc.).
More Secure: Data is stored on your device, so it's less vulnerable to online attacks.

Cons:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only on One Device: You can only use it on the device it’s installed on.
Needs Updates: You have to manually update the app.
Costly to Develop: You need different versions for each platform (Windows, macOS).
Takes Up Space: It uses storage on your device.
Web Applications

Pros:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Anywhere: You can access it from any device with a browser and internet.
No Installation: Just open it in a browser, no need to install anything.
Works on Any Device: Works on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
Automatic Updates: The app updates automatically, so you always have the latest version.

Cons:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Needs Internet: You need an internet connection to use it.
Slower: May not be as fast as desktop apps.
Limited Device Access: Doesn’t have full access to your device's features.
Less Secure: Being online makes it more vulnerable to cyber attacks.


In short:
Desktop apps are good for fast, offline use with full access to your device, but they need installation and take up space.
Web apps are convenient, easy to access, and work on multiple devices but need the internet and can be slower.
