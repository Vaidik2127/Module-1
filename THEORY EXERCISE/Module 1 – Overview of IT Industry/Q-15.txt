Q-15. Github and Introductions.
Ans:- GitHub is a platform for sharing and collaborating on code. You can create repositories to store projects, track changes with
      Git, and work with others using features like branches and pull requests.

To get started:
--------------------
    Create an account at GitHub.
    Set up Git on your computer.
    Create a repository, clone it, and start adding code with git add, git commit, and git push.

For introductions:
---------------------
    Profile: Add a README with your skills, interests, and contact info.
    Project: Write a README explaining what your project does and how to contribute.

Why is version control important in software development?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # Version control is essential in software development because it helps teams manage code changes efficiently and ensures project 
    consistency. 

Key Reasons for Version Control:-
-----------------------------------
Tracks Changes: Keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to review or revert to previous versions.

Collaboration: Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

Branching and Merging: Enables developers to experiment with new features or fixes in isolated branches, then merge them safely 
into the main codebase.

Error Recovery: Simplifies undoing mistakes by restoring a stable version of the code.

Transparency: Provides a clear log of who made what changes and why, aiding accountability.

Backup: Acts as a centralized backup for the codebase.
