Q-29. What are the differences between native and hybrid mobile apps?
Ans:- Here are the simple differences between native and hybrid mobile apps:

Platform:
Native: Made for one platform (like iPhone or Android).
Hybrid: Works on both iPhone and Android using one code.

Technology:
Native: Built using the platform’s own programming languages (e.g., Swift for iOS, Java for Android).
Hybrid: Uses web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Performance:
Native: Faster and smoother because it uses the phone’s resources directly.
Hybrid: Slower since it runs through a web browser inside the app.

User Experience:
Native: Best user experience for that platform (feels like part of the phone).
Hybrid: Can feel less smooth or different across devices.

Features Access:
Native: Has full access to phone features (camera, GPS, etc.).
Hybrid: May have limited access to some phone features.

Development Time:
Native: Takes longer because you need to create separate apps for each platform.
Hybrid: Quicker since one code works for both platforms.

Cost:
Native: More expensive due to separate development for each platform.
Hybrid: Cheaper as you only need to develop one app.
