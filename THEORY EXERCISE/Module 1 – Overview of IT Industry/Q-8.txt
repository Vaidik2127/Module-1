Q-8. Protocols.
Ans:- Protocols are rules that devices follow to communicate with each other over a network. They ensure data is sent, 
      received, and understood properly.

Examples:
    HTTP: For browsing websites.
    SMTP: For sending emails.
    Wi-Fi: For wireless internet.

What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?

    Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Full Form
        ------------------
HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol.
HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.

            Security
        -------------------
HTTP: No security; data is sent as plain text, making it vulnerable to hackers.
HTTPS: Secure; data is encrypted using SSL/TLS, protecting it from unauthorized access.

            URL Format
        --------------------
HTTP: URLs start with http://.
HTTPS: URLs start with https://.

            Data Encryption
        ---------------------
HTTP: No encryption, making sensitive information (like passwords) unsafe.
HTTPS: Encrypts data, making it safe for online transactions.

            Use Case
        ----------------------
HTTP: Used for general websites where security isn’t a concern.
HTTPS: Used for secure sites like banks, online shopping, and login pages.

            Performance
        -----------------------
HTTP: Faster because there’s no encryption overhead.
HTTPS: Slightly slower due to encryption, but modern systems minimize the difference.
