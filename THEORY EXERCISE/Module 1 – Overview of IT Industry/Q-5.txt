Q-5. Network Layers on Client and Server.
Ans:- TCP/IP Model: Overview
            The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is the backbone of the internet and other modern     
            networks. It provides a set of standardized rules for communication between devices, enabling data to be sent and 
            received over a network. It has four layers, each responsible for specific tasks in data communication.

TCP/IP Model Layers and Their Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Application Layer
            Function: Provides interfaces for software to communicate over a network. It handles user services like file transfer,
            email, and web browsing.
            Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc.
        
        Transport Layer
            Function: Ensures reliable delivery of data between devices. It handles error detection, retransmission, and flow control.
            Protocols:
            TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
            UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Provides faster, connectionless communication but without reliability.
        
        Internet Layer
            Function: Handles the logical addressing and routing of data packets between networks. It ensures that data reaches 
            the correct destination.
            Protocols:
            IP (Internet Protocol): Responsible for addressing and routing packets.
            ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for error messages and diagnostics (e.g., ping).
            ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.
        
        Network Access Layer (Link Layer)
            Function: Manages the physical transmission of data over the network. It handles framing, MAC addresses, and data
            transfer through hardware.
            Technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, DSL, etc.
            Client and Server
            The client-server model is a foundational concept in networking, where devices communicate using the TCP/IP model.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Client:-
    A client is a device or software application that requests services or resources from a server.
    Example: A web browser like Chrome sends an HTTP request to a web server to fetch a webpage.
    Characteristics:
    Initiates communication.
    Usually runs on user devices.
    Can be lightweight and requires only enough resources to request and display data.

Server:-
    A server is a device or software application that provides services or resources in response to client requests.
    Example: A web server processes HTTP requests and sends back webpages to the browser.
    Characteristics:
    Waits for and responds to client requests.
    Typically more powerful with higher processing and storage capabilities.
    Can serve multiple clients simultaneously.

    Relationship Between TCP/IP and Client-Server Model
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Application Layer: The client and server communicate using protocols like HTTP, FTP, or SMTP.
    Transport Layer: Ensures data is delivered reliably or quickly, depending on whether TCP or UDP is used.
    Internet Layer: Routes the data between the client's and server's IP addresses.
    Network Access Layer: Handles the actual data transmission over physical or wireless networks.
