Q-20. What are the main stages of the software development process?
Ans:- The software development process is typically organized into several main stages to ensure the efficient delivery of high-quality
      software. These stages are often represented as part of methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, or DevOps, but the core stages 
      remain consistent across models:

1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
    Goal: Define the scope, objectives, and feasibility of the software project.
        Activities:
            Identify stakeholders and gather requirements.
            Analyze the problem domain and set project goals.
            Assess feasibility (technical, economic, and operational).
            Create a project plan and define success metrics.
Outputs:
Requirement Specifications Document.
Project Plan with timelines and milestones.

2. System Design
    Goal: Create a blueprint for how the software will work.
        Activities:
            Define the architecture (e.g., client-server, microservices).
            Design data flow diagrams, database schemas, and user interfaces.
            Specify hardware and software requirements.
            Develop test strategies.
Outputs:
System Design Documents (High-Level Design and Low-Level Design).
Prototype (if applicable).

3. Development (Coding)
    Goal: Write the actual code for the software based on design specifications.
        Activities:
            Set up the development environment.
            Break down tasks into smaller modules or user stories.
            Write, review, and optimize code.
            Version control (e.g., using Git) to manage changes.
Outputs:
Source Code.
Updated Documentation (inline comments, API documentation).

4. Testing
    Goal: Ensure the software meets requirements and is free of defects.
        Activities:
            Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
            Automate testing where feasible (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
            Identify and fix bugs or performance issues.
Outputs:
Test Reports.
Bug Fixes and Patches.

5. Deployment
    Goal: Make the software available to users in the target environment.
        Activities:
            Deploy the software to staging and production environments.
            Configure servers, databases, and integrations.
            Provide training or documentation for end-users.
Outputs:
Deployed Software.
Deployment Scripts and Documentation.

6. Maintenance and Support
    Goal: Ensure the software remains functional, secure, and relevant after deployment.
        Activities:
            Monitor for bugs, crashes, or performance issues.
            Provide updates or patches to fix issues or improve functionality.
            Upgrade the software to adapt to new requirements or technologies.
Outputs:
Maintenance Logs.
Updated Software Versions.

Optional Stages
    Prototyping:
A preliminary version of the software created to gather feedback before full-scale development.

    Retirement:
Decommissioning outdated software while migrating to newer systems if necessary.

Iterative Models
For methodologies like Agile or DevOps, the above stages are not strictly linear. Instead, they follow iterative cycles with regular

feedback loops:

Agile: Development is broken into sprints, and stages are revisited in each sprint.
DevOps: Testing and deployment are automated, emphasizing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).
