Q-32. How do flowcharts help in programming and system design?
Ans:- Flowcharts are helpful in programming and system design because they provide a clear, visual way to represent processes. 

1. Simplify Complex Processes
Flowcharts break down complex tasks into simple, easy-to-understand steps, making it easier to see how a program or system works.

2. Easy Communication
They provide a visual way to explain how a system or program works, making it easier to communicate ideas to team members or 
non-technical stakeholders.

3. Identify Problems Early
By mapping out processes, flowcharts help identify potential issues, bottlenecks, or missing steps before actual development begins.

4. Improve Debugging
Flowcharts help trace the logic of a program, making it easier to find errors and understand how the program should behave.

5. Plan Logic and Workflow
They help plan and organize the logic of a program or the flow of data in a system, ensuring that every step is accounted for.

6. Document Processes
Flowcharts act as documentation that can be referred to later during development or maintenance, helping others understand the 
system's design.

7. Guide Development
Developers use flowcharts to follow a logical progression of steps, ensuring they implement features or write code in the right order.
