Q-7. Types of Internet Connections.
Ans:- Internet connections can vary based on the technology and medium used to transmit data. Here are the common types
      of internet connections:

        1. Dial-Up Connection
            Technology: Uses traditional telephone lines (POTS) to connect to the internet.
            Speed: Very slow, up to 56 kbps.
            Characteristics:
            Requires a modem.
            Occupies the phone line while in use.
            Usage: Rarely used today due to advancements in technology.

        2. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
            Technology: Uses telephone lines but operates on different frequencies, allowing simultaneous internet and phone use.
            Speed: Typically ranges from 256 kbps to 100 Mbps.
            Characteristics:
            Available in areas with landline infrastructure.
            Speed decreases with distance from the provider’s central office.

        3. Cable Internet
            Technology: Transmits data through coaxial cables, the same used for cable TV.
            Speed: Typically ranges from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps.
            Characteristics:
            Speeds may vary depending on neighborhood usage (shared bandwidth).
            Offers high-speed internet.

        4. Fiber-Optic Internet
            Technology: Transmits data as light signals through glass or plastic fibers.
            Speed: Up to 10 Gbps or more.
            Characteristics:
            Extremely fast and reliable.
            Expanding availability but not yet widespread.

        5. Satellite Internet
            Technology: Uses satellites to beam internet signals to dishes installed at the user’s location.
            Speed: Typically ranges from 12 Mbps to 100 Mbps.
            Characteristics:
            Accessible in remote and rural areas.
            Prone to latency and weather-related disruptions.

        6. Wireless Internet (Fixed Wireless)
            Technology: Transmits internet signals via radio waves from a fixed antenna.
            Speed: Ranges from 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps, depending on the provider.
            Characteristics:
            Ideal for rural areas.
            Requires line-of-sight between the tower and receiver.

        7. Mobile Broadband (3G, 4G, 5G)
            Technology: Uses cellular networks to provide internet access to mobile devices.
            Speed:
            3G: Up to 2 Mbps.
            4G: 10-100 Mbps.
            5G: 1-10 Gbps (and improving).
            Characteristics:
            Portable and widely available.
            Data limits may apply.

        8. Hotspots
            Technology: Wireless networks created by mobile devices or dedicated devices (e.g., Mi-Fi).
            Speed: Depends on the underlying mobile broadband network (3G, 4G, or 5G).
            Characteristics:
            Convenient for on-the-go connectivity.
            May consume mobile data plans.

        9. Broadband Over Power Lines (BPL)
            Technology: Transmits internet data over electrical power lines.
            Speed: Comparable to DSL or cable.
            Characteristics:
            Limited adoption.
            Susceptible to interference.

     How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Technology
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadband: General term for high-speed internet. It can use phone lines (DSL), TV cables, or satellites.
Fiber-Optic: A type of broadband that uses special cables made of glass or plastic to send data as light.

    Speed
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadband: Speeds vary depending on the type (e.g., DSL is slower, cable is faster).
Fiber-Optic: Much faster than other types, often 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps.

    Reliability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadband: Can slow down due to distance or shared use (e.g., cable in busy neighborhoods).
Fiber-Optic: Very reliable and consistent, not affected by distance or weather.

    Availability
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadband: Found almost everywhere.
Fiber-Optic: Available in fewer places but expanding.

    Cost
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadband: Usually cheaper but slower.
Fiber-Optic: Costs more but gives better speed and performance.
