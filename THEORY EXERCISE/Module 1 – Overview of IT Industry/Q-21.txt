Q-21. Why is the requirement analysis phase critical in software development?
Ans:- The requirement analysis phase is critical in software development because it lays the foundation for the entire project.
      Here's why it's so important:

1.Clear Understanding of Stakeholder Needs: It ensures that the development team fully understands the needs and expectations of 
  the users, clients, and other stakeholders. This helps in defining the scope of the project and prevents misunderstandings later on.

2.Prevention of Scope Creep: Well-defined requirements help prevent scope creep—when the project expands beyond its original 
  objectives—by providing a clear, agreed-upon set of deliverables and goals.

3.Improved Project Planning: Accurate requirements enable better planning in terms of time, resources, and budget. Estimating 
  the time and cost for development is much easier when the requirements are well-understood.

4.Design and Architecture Foundation: The requirements form the basis for the system's design and architecture. Without a clear
  set of requirements, the development team may waste time on building features that are not required or fail to implement critical 
  functionality.

5.Quality Assurance and Testing: Requirements provide a baseline for testing the system. Test cases can be directly derived from 
  the requirements, ensuring that the developed system meets the needs and functions as intended.

6.Risk Reduction: It helps identify potential risks early in the project. By understanding the requirements up front, you can 
  anticipate technical, operational, or business challenges and plan mitigations accordingly.

7.User Satisfaction: By properly analyzing and addressing user requirements, you increase the chances of delivering a product 
  that meets user expectations, which is critical for adoption and success.

8.Minimizing Rework: If the requirements are well-defined and understood at the start, the chances of major revisions during the 
  development process decrease, saving time and effort.
