Q-6. Explain Client Server Communication.
Ans:-Client-Server Communication: Simple Explanation
    Client-server communication is how two devices (a client and a server) talk to each other over a network to exchange information.

How It Works:
    Client Sends a Request:
        The client (e.g., your web browser) asks for something from the server (e.g., a webpage).

    Server Receives and Processes:
        The server listens for the request, processes it (e.g., fetches the webpage), and prepares a response.

    Server Sends a Response:
        The server sends the requested information or an error message back to the client.

    Client Displays or Uses the Response:
        The client takes the response (e.g., webpage data) and shows it to the user.
    
Key Examples:
    Web Browsing:
        Client: Your browser.
        Server: Website's hosting server.
        Communication: Browser requests a webpage; the server sends it back.

    Email:
        Client: Your email app (e.g., Gmail).
        Server: Email server.
        Communication: Client fetches emails or sends a new email.

Protocols (Rules for Communication):
    HTTP/HTTPS: Used for websites.
    FTP: Used for file transfers.
    SMTP/IMAP: Used for sending/receiving emails.

Why Itâ€™s Useful:
    Centralized data storage (on servers).
    Multiple clients can access the same server at the same time.
    Makes things like browsing, gaming, and emailing possible.
