Q-22. What is the role of software analysis in the development process?
Ans:- Software analysis plays a critical role in the software development process as it serves as the bridge between understanding 
      the problem and crafting a solution. Its role can be summarized as follows:

1. Problem Understanding
Identifies Needs: Software analysis focuses on understanding the actual problem or opportunity that the software aims to address.
Clarifies Ambiguities: It helps resolve ambiguities or conflicting information from stakeholders.

2. Requirement Gathering and Documentation
Elicits Requirements: It involves interacting with stakeholders to gather functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (how the system performs) requirements.
Creates Formal Documentation: Provides structured documentation like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), which serves as a reference throughout the project.

3. System Feasibility
Technical Feasibility: Evaluates if the technology and resources are adequate to meet the requirements.
Economic Feasibility: Ensures the project is financially viable.
Operational Feasibility: Assesses if the solution aligns with the organization’s processes and users.

4. Scope Definition
Defines Boundaries: Clearly outlines what the software will and will not do, reducing misunderstandings and scope creep.
Sets Priorities: Helps prioritize features based on stakeholder importance, budget, and timelines.

5. Architectural and Design Guidance
Foundation for Design: Analysis informs the system architecture and detailed design decisions by defining how components should interact and behave.
Identifies Dependencies: Highlights any external systems, APIs, or data integrations needed.

6. Risk Management
Identifies Risks: Helps uncover potential technical, operational, or business risks early in the project.
Proposes Mitigation: Provides strategies to address these risks proactively.

7. Improves Communication
Aligns Stakeholders: Acts as a communication tool to align developers, testers, and stakeholders with a shared understanding of the project’s goals and requirements.
Bridges Gaps: Reduces misunderstandings between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

8. Supports Validation and Verification
Validation: Ensures the requirements reflect what stakeholders truly need.
Verification: Provides criteria to check if the system, when implemented, meets the specified requirements.

9. Cost and Time Estimation
Supports Planning: Enables realistic estimates of the time and resources required for development.
Optimizes Budget: Helps balance cost by identifying essential versus optional features.

10. Facilitates Change Management
Tracks Changes: Provides a baseline to assess the impact of changes to requirements during development.
Supports Flexibility: Helps the team adapt to evolving needs without compromising the overall goal.
