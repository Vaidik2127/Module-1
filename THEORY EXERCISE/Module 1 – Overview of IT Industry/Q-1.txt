Q-1. What is a Program?
Ans:-A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that a computer can execute to perform specific
     tasks or solve problems. Programs are the foundation of all software, ranging from simple tools like calculators to complex 
     applications like web browsers, operating systems, and artificial intelligence systems.

Key Components of a Program:

    1.	Instructions: The steps or commands the computer follows, written in a programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
    2.	Input: Data provided to the program to process (e.g., user input, files, or sensor data).
    3.	Processing: The logic or computation performed by the program on the input data.
    4.	Output: The result or feedback produced by the program, which could be displayed on the screen, stored in a file, or 
        sent to another system.

Types of Programs:

    •	Application Programs: Designed for end-users, like word processors, games, or mobile apps.
    •	System Programs: Help manage and operate the computer hardware, like operating systems or utility programs.
