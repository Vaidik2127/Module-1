Q-30. What is the significance of DFDs in system analysis?
Ans:- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are important in system analysis because they help visualize how data moves through a system. 

1.Clear Representation of Processes:
DFDs show how data is processed at different stages and by different parts of the system, helping analysts understand 
the flow of information.

2.Simplifies Complex Systems:
They break down complex systems into simpler parts, making it easier to understand and analyze how the system works.

3.Identifying Data Sources and Destinations:
DFDs highlight where data comes from (inputs) and where it goes (outputs), helping to identify data sources, storage, and destinations.

4.Helps with Problem Identification:
By mapping out the system, DFDs can highlight bottlenecks, missing data flows, or areas where processes can be improved.

5.Facilitates Communication:
They serve as a tool for communicating system functionality between stakeholders (like developers, analysts, and clients),
ensuring everyone is on the same page.

6.Documentation and Analysis:
DFDs provide a clear, visual documentation of the systemâ€™s data flow, which can be referred to during development, testing, 
and future maintenance.

7.Supports Requirement Gathering:
They are useful during the requirements analysis phase to capture the detailed flow of data and ensure the system meets user needs.
